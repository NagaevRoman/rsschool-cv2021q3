## About Me
----
28 years old, married, no children. In 2013 at PSU for the specialty of industrial electronics,
graduated in 2017 and entered the same university, in master's degree (in absentia) in the specialty Telecommunications - free of charge. He studied for a year and then took the documents, because he did not see the point in training. Currently working at Europribor.ltd, specialty Automated Production Control Systems Engineer. At the beginning of the year he began to be interested in programming, studied the question and, on the recommendation of friends, began to study the basics of JS, html and css. Having entered the courses, I want to consolidate my current knowledge and get new ones, learn modern technologies for working with the web, learn my capabilities in the field of programming and in the future find a job as a JavaScript developer.
